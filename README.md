A Python program for Sudoku solving typically uses a backtracking algorithm to fill in the empty cells of a 9x9 grid while adhering to Sudoku rules: each row, column, and 3x3 sub-grid must contain digits from 1 to 9 without repetition. The program starts by identifying empty cells, tries placing a number in each cell, and recursively checks for valid solutions. If a conflict arises, it backtracks and tries the next number until the puzzle is solved or determined unsolvable. Advanced implementations may include optimization techniques like constraint propagation for faster solving.
